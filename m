It doesn't catch more lockups. On powerpc we don't have a reliable
periodic NMI hence the SMP checker. But it is preferable that a CPU
detects its own lockup because NMI IPIs can result in crashes if
they are taken in certain critical sections.

The powerpc SMP checker could certainly move to common code if
others wanted to use it.

CPU2                     CPU3
spin_lock_irqsave(A)     spin_lock_irqsave(B)
spin_lock_irqsave(B)     spin_lock_irqsave(A)

CPU1 will detect the lockup on CPU2, but CPU3's lockup won't be
detected so we don't get the trace that can diagnose the bug.

Another thing I actually found it useful for is you can easily
see if a core (i.e., all threads in the core) or a chip has
died. Maybe more useful when doing presilicon and bring up work
or firmware hacking, but still useful.

Thanks,
Nick
