While I appreciate the sudden eagerness to implement these instructions
in QEMU after them not being supported for 15 years, I'd suggest that
the instructions for the more modern algorithms should be prioritized.

lib/crypto/ and crypto/ already largely provides that distinction, no?

The kernel already has perfectly good support for inline storage
encryption in the block layer.  See
Documentation/block/inline-encryption.rst.  It's a completely different
model from non-inline crypto engines.  Trying to create some common
abstraction is not going to succeed.

They do it anyway.  It's a checkbox feature.  I.e. the purpose is for it
to be advertised on a list of features.

I'm quite familiar with how fscrypt is being used on mobile, thanks.
Most people do use hardware offload with fscrypt, but it is *inline*
hardware offload.  That remains fully supported via blk-crypto and is
unrelated to the crypto API.  The rest just use the CPU.

I've only ever heard of one case almost a decade ago where someone
intentionally used a non-inline offload engine with fscrypt.  And I even
recently showed that on the same line of SoCs that was being used in
that case, it is no longer worth it, if it ever was.

Every other case has just been someone using one by mistake and getting
their performance tanked or encountering driver bugs as a result.

Anyway, this seems very off-topic for this thread, which is about
whether the architecture-optimized DES and 3DES code should be removed.
