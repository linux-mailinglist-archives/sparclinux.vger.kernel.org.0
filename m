What I tried to say is that on this platform, we have such cases, but that=
=20
being said they do not cause regression (and they cannot be "fixed" by the=
=20
same means either).

None of these BARs (non-VF and VF ones) would not get assigned because of=
=20
the IORESOURCE_PREFETCH check in pci_find_parent_resource() but=20
post-754babaaf333 ("sparc/PCI: Remove pcibios_enable_device() as they do=20
nothing extra"), enable device just doesn't like that. But because VF=20
BARs are treated "optional", only non-VF BARs cause enable fail=20
(unrelated to this issue, I got asked this week why VF resources are=20
optional and realized I don't know the answer myself).

I'd missed this change (IIRC, I only read CBs only up to r6.2 and then=20
r6.4 to r7.0).

=2E..If we look VF BAR flags on general level, could we now actually set=20
IORESOURCE_PREFETCH in decode_bar() if it's a 64-bit BAR on a PCIe=20
device? That should make those VF BARs and other non-pref 64-bit "right"=20
and it would be rather straightforward way to differentiate PCI vs PCIe=20
use cases.

Abolish 64-bit non-pref goes to non-prefetchable window rule, or more like=
=20
replace it with some rule that depends on conventional PCI being present=20
or not, doesn't look that complicated change thanks to the addition of=20
pbus_select_window_for_type() which consolidates these decision into a=20
central place (but it would require finding out if there's conventional=20
PCI involved which requires more work such as walking the device hierarchy=
=20
or maintaining flag which tells that information). Only the assignment=20
still run on its own fallback rules independent of=20
pbus_select_window_for_type() and of course that=20
pci_find_parent_resource() (this should probably be renamed to _for_addr=20
or something along those lines to better align with=20
pbus_select_window_for_type()).

Out of those two approaches, to keep conventional PCI compability, it=20
would be probably more straightforward to just make any PCIe 64-bit BAR=20
IORESOURCE_PREFETCH but that isn't as clearly connected to the intended=20
logic decision which is "conventional PCI or not?" but I guess a comment=20
in decode_bar() and perhaps in ioport.h would be good enough the explain=20
it.

Related to this, the root bus resource flags are a mess, IORESOURCE_MEM_64=
=20
is not always there even if addresses are clearly 64-bit and parent=20
resource selection there should probably be agnostic to=20
IORESOURCE_PREFETCH (which is currently not done as cleanly as it could be=
=20
but just as artifacts the fallbacks have).
