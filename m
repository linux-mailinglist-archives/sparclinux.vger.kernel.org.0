Ah, thanks for the heads up! We've been thinking about turning this on
in production in ChromeOS because it will help us track down a whole
class of field-generated crash reports that are otherwise opaque to
us. It sounds as if maybe that's not a good idea quite yet? Do you
have any idea of how much farther along this needs to go? ...of
course, we've also run into issues with Mediatek devices because they
don't save/restore GICR registers properly [1]. In theory, we might be
able to work around that in the kernel.

In any case, even if there are bugs that would prevent turning this on
for production, it still seems like we could still land this series.
It simply wouldn't do anything until someone turned on pseudo NMIs,
which wouldn't happen till the kinks are worked out.

...actually, I guess I should say that if all the patches of the
current series do land then it actually _would_ still do something,
even without pseudo-NMI. Assuming the last patch looks OK, it would at
least start falling back to using regular IPIs to do backtraces. That
wouldn't get backtraces on hard locked up CPUs but it would be better
than what we have today where we don't get any backtraces. This would
get arm64 on par with arm32...
