This is something else. Currently the rules are:

[A]

// pausing forbidden
enable()
    pause()
    // pausing/enabling forbidden
    resume()
disable()

David suggested allowing:

[B]

pause()
// pausing/enabling forbidden
resume()

Your suggestion is also allowing:

[C]

pause()
    // pausing forbidden
    enable()
    disable()
resume()

And finally:

[D]

pause()
    pause()
        enable()
        disable()
    resume()
resume()

I don't really mind either way, but I don't see an immediate use for [C]
and [D] - the idea is that the paused section is short and controlled,
not made up of arbitrary calls. A potential downside of allowing [C] and
[D] is that it makes it harder to detect unintended nesting (fewer
VM_WARN assertions). Happy to implement it if this proves useful though.

OTOH the idea behind [B] is that it allows the caller of
pause()/resume() not to care about whether lazy MMU is actually enabled
or not - i.e. the kasan helpers would keep working even if
apply_to_page_range() didn't use lazy MMU any more.

I suppose the best we can do is document it alongside those helpers
(David has already suggested some documentation, see patch 11).

Yep sounds like the best option - a lot less risk of misuse if it can't
be called from generic code :) The build would still succeed on arch's
that implement it, but the kernel CI should catch such calls sooner or
later.
