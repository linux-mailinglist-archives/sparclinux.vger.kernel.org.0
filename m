Hi Dave and Andreas.

Starting a new thread to get some visibility.

See full thread here:

We are in the need of someone that can pick up the sparc patches that
floats around and push them towards Linus - they are often lingering
until Andrew or Arnd picks them, but having a more direct route would be
nice.

I am happy to assist with reviews for the areas I have some experience
with, as I still feel a bit love for the sparc stuff. But cannot commit
to more than that as this is all in my free time.

Thoughts?

	Sam
