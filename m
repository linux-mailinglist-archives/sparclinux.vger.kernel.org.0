My Name Mrs. Rose Kone

I am writing you base on your good profile. I am in search of a
property to buy in your country; I intended to come over to
your country for investment? I believe that I have to partner with a
citizen to be safe in investing in your country. My name is Mrs.
Rose Kone,My late husband deals on Crude Oil with Federal
Government of Sudan and we have a private Oil firm in Bentiu Oil zone
town and Upper Nile city.

What I have experience physically, I don't wish to experience it again
in my life due to the recent civil and Ethnic crises caused by our
President Mr.Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Mr. Riek Machar, I have
been Under United Nation refugee camp in Rue De Bass am west Africa,
to save my life and that of my little daughter.

I want to solicit for your partnership with trust to transfer and
invest with my fund deposited at (Arab Bank for Economic Development
in Africa BADEA) by my late husband,I will disclose the Amount to you
as we proceed. I need your help to move this fund to your country,
because my life is no longer safe in Africa, since the rebels are
looking for the families of all the oil business partners in the
country, very scaring I wish you will understand my predicaments. But
the truth is that I and my daughter was lucky to be part of the bagde
taken by UN KEEPING FORCE to Addis Ababa our Neighboring country where
I WE BOARD to Abidjan Ivory Coast,


We left  Sudan and move to Addis Ababa our neighboring country with
the few days ceasefire which was announced by United Nation Peace
keeping Force., Because of  face to face peace meeting accord
coordinated by US Secretary of State, and United Nations in Ethiopia
(Addis Ababa) between The sitting President Mr. Salva Kiir and the
rebel leader Mr. Riek Machar to stop this war.

I will send you the document of the fund with other details for your
acknowledgement and prove.


With love from
Mrs.Rose Kone
