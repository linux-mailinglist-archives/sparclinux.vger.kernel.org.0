Ah, I think that this was actually pretty serious bug in the perf
detector. But I think that it should work another way, see below.

If we clear watchdog_hardlockup_touch() here then
watchdog_hardlockup_check() won't be called yet another
watchdog_hrtimer_sample_threshold perior.

It means that any touch will cause ignoring one full period.
The is_hardlockup() check will be done after full two periods.

It is not ideal, see below.

The original code looks wrong. arch_touch_nmi_watchdog() caused
skipping only one period of the perf event.

I would expect that it caused restarting the period,
something like:

	if (__this_cpu_read(watchdog_nmi_touch) == true) {
		/*
		 * Restart the period after which the interrupt
		 * counter is checked.
		 */
		__this_cpu_write(nmi_rearmed, 0);
		__this_cpu_write(last_timestamp, now);
		__this_cpu_write(watchdog_nmi_touch, false);
		return;
	}

By other words, we should restart the period in the very next perf
event after the watchdog was touched.

That said, the new code looks better than the original.
IMHO, the original code was prone to false positives.

Best Regards,
Petr

PS: It might be worth fixing this problem in a separate patch at the
    beginning of this patchset. It might be a candidate for stable
    backports.
