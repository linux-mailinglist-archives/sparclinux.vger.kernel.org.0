Sorry, I was wrong.

In this case, both VMAs are writable, the pte's writable bit is
cleared by pte_wrprotect. So if pte_mkdirty sets hardware writable bit
unconditionally, then there will be no way to catch writes to
implement COW.

I will try to explain how it works about pte write, dirty and
write-protect on LoongArch in the LoongArch mailing-list.

Ray
