I agree.  BUT please don't just run out and post new patches to do
this.  Let's talk about Arnd's further ideas below first.

I really like this idea.

pci_write_config_*() has one return value, and only 100ish of 2500
callers check for errors.  It's sometimes possible for config
accessors to detect PCI errors and return failure, e.g., device was
removed or didn't respond, but most of them don't, and detecting these
errors is not really that valuable.

pci_read_config_*() is much more interesting because it returns two
things, the function return value and the value read from the PCI
device, and it's complicated to check both. 

Again it's sometimes possible for config read accessors to detect PCI
errors, but in most cases a PCI error means the accessor returns
success and the value from PCI is ~0.

Checking the function return value catches programming errors (bad
alignment, etc) but misses most of the interesting errors (device was
unplugged or reported a PCI error).

Checking the value returned from PCI is tricky because ~0 is a valid
value for some config registers, and only the driver knows for sure.
If the driver knows that ~0 is a possible value, it would have to do
something else, e.g., another config read of a register that *cannot*
be ~0, to see whether it's really an error.

I suspect that if we had a single value to look at it would be easier
to get right.  Error checking with current interface would look like
this:

  err = pci_read_config_word(dev, addr, &val);
  if (err)
    return -EINVAL;

  if (PCI_POSSIBLE_ERROR(val)) {
    /* if driver knows ~0 is invalid */
    return -EINVAL;

    /* if ~0 is potentially a valid value */
    err = pci_read_config_word(dev, PCI_VENDOR_ID, &val2);
    if (err)
      return -EINVAL;

    if (PCI_POSSIBLE_ERROR(val2))
      return -EINVAL;
  }

Error checking with a possible interface that returned only a single
value could look like this:

  val = pci_config_read_word(dev, addr);
  if (PCI_POSSIBLE_ERROR(val)) {
    /* if driver knows ~0 is invalid */
    return -EINVAL;

    /* if ~0 is potentially a valid value */
    val2 = pci_config_read_word(dev, PCI_VENDOR_ID);
    if (PCI_POSSIBLE_ERROR(val2))
      return -EINVAL;
  }

Am I understanding you correctly?

I like this idea a lot, too.  I think the fact that
pci_bus_read_config_word() requires a pci_bus * complicates things in
a few places.

I think it's completely separate, as you say, and we should defer it
for now because even part a) is a lot of work.  I added it to my list
of possible future projects.
