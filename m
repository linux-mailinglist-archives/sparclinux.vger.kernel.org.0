Love Greetings

I will introduce myself as Mr. Pressley Anton. a South African citizen 
living in East London. A director of accounting who oversees the bank's 
financial network

I ask for your approval to introduce you to our bank as a business 
partner. Ms. Surti Dahlia, a German / Dutch businesswoman and widow from 
the Netherlands, who died in a MH370 Malaysia aircraft

So we can say that their fund was worth eight million five hundred 
thousand pounds



We can legally move this amount if you are interested.
Many thanks

Greetings,
Mr. Pressley Anton.
