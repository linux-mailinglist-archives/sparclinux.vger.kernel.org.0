Hello My Dear friend.

I am Mrs. Maya Oliver, from Norway
. Firstly, I am married to Mr. Patrick Oliver, A diamond and gold
merchant who owns a small gold Mine in Burkina Faso and Egypt Cairo;
He died of Cardiovascular Disease in mid-March 2011. During his
lifetime he deposited the sum of =E2=82=AC 18.5 Million Euro) Eighteen
million, Five hundred thousand Euros in a bank in Ouagadougou the
capital city of Burkina Faso. The deposited money was from the sale of
the shares, death benefits payment and entitlements of my deceased
husband by his company.

Since his death I decided not to remarry, When my late husband was
Alive he deposited the sum of =E2=82=AC 8.5 Million Euro) Eight million, Fi=
ve hundred
thousand Euro) in a bank in Burkina Faso, Presently this money is
still in bank. And My Doctor told me that I don't have much time to
live because of the cancer problem,

Having known my condition I decided to hand you over this fund to take
care of the less-privileged people, you will utilize this money the
way I am going to instruct herein. I want you to take 35% Percent of
the total money for your personal use While 65% of the money will go
to charity" people and helping the orphanage.

I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by the Government. I grew
up as an Orphan and I don't have anybody as my family member,
I am expecting your respond. Through private email: (mrs.mayaolivia90@gmail=
