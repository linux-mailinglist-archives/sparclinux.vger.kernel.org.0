I don't quite understand. I'd agree that the special case for
CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG is ugly, but it was also ugly before. IMO
it's actually a little less ugly / easier to understand after my
patch. ...but let me walk through how I think this special case works
and maybe you can tell me where I'm confused.

The first thing to understand is that CONFIG_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF
and CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG are mutually exclusive from each other.
This was true before any of my patches and is still true after them.
Specifically, if CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG is defined then an
architecture implements arch_touch_nmi_watchdog() (as documented in
the Kconfig docs for HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG). Looking at the tree before my
series you can see that the perf hardlockup detector also implemented
arch_touch_nmi_watchdog(). This would have caused a conflict. The
mutual exclusion was presumably enforced by an architecture not
defining both HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG and HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF.

The second thing to understand is that an architecture that defines
CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG is _not_ required to implement
watchdog_hardlockup_probe() (used to be called watchdog_nmi_probe()).
Maybe this should change, but at the very least it appears that
SPARC64 defines HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG but doesn't define
watchdog_hardlockup_probe() AKA watchdog_nmi_probe(). Anyone who
defines CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG and doesn't implement
watchdog_hardlockup_probe() is claiming that their watchdog needs no
probing and is always available.

So with that context:

1. We can't handle any special cases for CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG in
"kernel/watchdog_perf.c". The special cases that we need to handle are
all for the cases where CONFIG_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF isn't defined
and that means "kernel/watchdog_perf.c" isn't included.

2. We can't have the default __weak function return -ENODEV because
CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG doesn't require an arch to implement
watchdog_hardlockup_probe(), but we want watchdog_hardlockup_probe()
to return "no error" in that case so that
"watchdog_hardlockup_available" gets set to true.

Does that sound right?

I'd agree that a future improvement saying that
CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG means you _must_ implement
watchdog_hardlockup_probe() would make sense and that would allow us
to get rid of the special case. IMO, though, that's a separate patch.
I'd be happy to review that patch if you wanted to post it up. :-)

If we want to add that requirement, I _think_ the only thing you'd
need to do is to add watchdog_hardlockup_probe() to sparc64 and have
it return 0 and put that definition in the same file containing
arch_touch_nmi_watchdog(). powerpc also gets CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG
as a side effect of selecting CONFIG_HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_ARCH but
it looks like they implement watchdog_hardlockup_probe() already. Oh,
but maybe this will fix a preexisting (existed before my patches)
minor bug... Unless I'm missing something (entirely possible!) on
powerpc today I guess if you turn off CONFIG_PPC_WATCHDOG then
CONFIG_HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_ARCH and CONFIG_HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG
would still be defined and we'd end up returning 0 (no error) from
watchdog_hardlockup_probe(). That means that on powerpc today if you
turn off CONFIG_PPC_WATCHDOG that '/proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog' will
still think the watchdog is enabled?
