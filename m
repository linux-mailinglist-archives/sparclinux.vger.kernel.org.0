I'm not picky here. I changed the name since Petr requested names to
be changed for any code I was touching [1] and so I threw this out as
a proposal. I agree that having two names can be confusing, but in
this case it didn't feel too terrible to me.

I'd love to hear Petr's opinion on this name change. I'm happy with:

a) This patch as it is.

b) Dropping this patch (or perhaps just changing it to add comments).

c) Changing this patch to rename all 70 uses of the old name. Assuming
this will go through Andrew Morton's tree, I'd be interested in
whether he's OK w/ this.

d) Dropping this patch from this series but putting it on the
backburner to try to do later (so that the rename can happen at a time
when it's least disruptive).

I'm happy to be corrected, but my understanding was that kernel devs
made an effort not to mess with things exported via "EXPORT_SYMBOL",
but things exported via "EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL" were fair game.

I guess maybe my patch calling it "ABI" is a stronger statement than
that, though. Doing a little more research, nobody wants to say that
things exported with "EXPORT_SYMBOL" are ABI, they just want to say
that we make an effort to have them be more stable.

So certainly I should adjust my patch series not to call it ABI, but
I'm still on the fence about whether I should rename this or not. I'd
love to hear other opinions. This rename actually would be a lot
easier than the touch_nmi_watchdog() one since the code referencing
the name "arch_touch_nmi_watchdog" isn't spread so broadly through the
kernel.
