ICL made a few SMP sparc32 systems.
I think the first ones used the original Cypress cpu running at 25MHz.
(I'm fairly sure these were SMP-capable, the later 40MHz definitely were.)
These were full sized VMEbus beasts.
Somewhere I've got a 32MByte memory board - over a square foot of board.
The memory is all 64k by 1 with all the pins on one edge and the chips vertical.
Really looks as though it should glow red and be used for cooking toast.
Even with 4 of those you're not going to run anything modern!

There were also some later mbus+sbus systems with dual sbus!
Designed by Fujitsu.

None of these ever ran solaris.
