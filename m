You can trim current linux down a bit, it's just non-obvious how. Unfortunately
there's an "expert" menu and CONFIG_EMBEDDED and if you touch anything there's
suddenly a hundred extra options in your config with no explanation of what they do.

At least 50% of what you want is probably disabling the printk strings that
aren't visible at your default verbosity level, but alas you must open pandora's
box to access those options...

A lot of people with hardware like this haven't stopped using it, they've just
stopped fighting with kernel upgrades. (Common issue in the embedded world. Not
really a fun thing for security, but )

My https://github.com/landley/toybox/blob/master/scripts/mkroot.sh ~250 line
bash script generates the simplest kernel configs for a bunch of platforms to
boot qemu to a shell prompt, but you then have to open the "expert" menu and
_disable_ stuff in order to get the size down from there.

> Also Sparc would probably be a good project for someone to extend/test

Sparc has a runtime relocation I've never understood but did manage to break
once, resulting in a long thread to fix:

http://lists.landley.net/pipermail/aboriginal-landley.net/2011-December/001964.html

Between that and the weird save half the stack register thing with function
calls on some sort of "wheel"... there's a _reason_ I haven't been able to talk
Rich into adding support for it to musl.

It is, sadly, my thing. The above 250 line bash script builds:

aarch64  armv7l  i686        mips    powerpc      s390x  x86_64
armv4l   armv7m  m68k        mips64  powerpc64    sh2eb
armv5l   i486    microblaze  mipsel  powerpc64le  sh4

That's toybox booting to a shell prompt and a linux kernel configured for qemu
for each target. Adding new targets looks something like:

elif [ "$TARGET" == m68k ]; then
  QEMU="m68k -M q800" KARCH=m68k KARGS=ttyS0 VMLINUX=vmlinux
KCONF=MMU,M68040,M68KFPU_EMU,MAC,SCSI_MAC_ESP,MACINTOSH_DRIVERS,ADB,ADB_MACII,NET_CORE,MACSONIC,SERIAL_PMACZILOG,SERIAL_PMACZILOG_TTYS,SERIAL_PMACZILOG_CONSOLE
elif [ "$TARGET" = s390x ]; then
  QEMU="s390x" KARCH=s390 VMLINUX=arch/s390/boot/bzImage
KCONF=MARCH_Z900,PACK_STACK,NET_CORE,VIRTIO_NET,VIRTIO_BLK,SCLP_TTY,SCLP_CONSOLE,SCLP_VT220_TTY,SCLP_VT220_CONSOLE,S390_GUEST

(Well, modulo thunderbird being unable to an indent a line that goes off the
right edge of the screen. The mozilla foundation somehow managed to spend half a
billion dollars in 2019 but it wasn't on thunderbird, I can tell you that.)

Anyway, I wrote a couple FAQ entries trying to explain the worst of it:

  https://landley.net/toybox/faq.html#cross
  https://landley.net/toybox/faq.html#mkroot

They're never sitting on the _last_ kernel version. They're generally way back
from there. Been true forever off of x86 (and now arm):
