Hey Dear Friend,

My name is Steven Chance Johnson a USA citizen. I am a retired US Navy officer
and i have as well worked as a retail Insurance and risk management
agent for 30yrs. I am married with two grown daughters.

I am interested in relocating my funds to a secured location.
Can you handle large amount of funds?
Can you send me your business profile?

The reasons I am transferring my funds from its current location are;

1. I received a letter from my bank, UBS in Switzerland requesting to
provide account for the transfer as my account is to be closed on or
before end of February, 2021.


2. The bank chooses to close my account in view of the current legal
battle with the US.

3. I cannot order this fund directly to my US bank account due to the matter on
ground between the UBS AG and the US Government.

If you are sure you can handle this, let me know as soon as you read
this message.

Kind regards,
Steven C.Johnson
