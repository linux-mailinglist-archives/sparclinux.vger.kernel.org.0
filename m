It's usually one of two things that happened before a platform gets
deleted for good:

* The platform port was (almost) exclusively done by one company
   with a commercial interest in it, and the company shifts its priorities
   for some reason (acquisition, bankruptcy, product cancellation,
   accidentally laying off all competent developers, ...) that causes it to
   stop working on it. Sometimes the previously paid maintainers
   keep up their upstream position, but without someone pushing the
   last missing bits into an official release, users are stuck on an old
   BSP kernel.

* A platform port is done in the open and actually works for upstream
  users, but over time the last active maintainers move on in their
  lives. Complex platforms inevitably break when a treewide change
  goes wrong, so we rely on users that are able to bisect and report
  bugs when they happen. After a platform has been broken for
  too long, even competent users may decide to just give up and
  stay on their last working kernel. Some of these platforms eventually
  recover when a new maintainer steps up or someone discovers they
  depend on newer kernels for products, but after a few years it's
  usually beyond repair.
