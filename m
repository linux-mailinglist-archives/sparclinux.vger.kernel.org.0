I see. Makes sense.

FWIW, Oracle engineers actually made some significant changes to the driver
that they never upstreamed, see:

https://github.com/oracle/linux-uek/commits/uek4/qu7/drivers/block/sunvdc.c

In particular, they added support for out-of-order execution:

https://github.com/oracle/linux-uek/commit/68f7c9c17fb80d29cbc1e5110f6c021f=
8da8d610

and they also changed the driver to use the BIO-based interface for VDC I/O=
 requests:

https://github.com/oracle/linux-uek/commit/4b725eb64cc10a4877f2af75ff3a7765=
86f68eb7

Could you review these two changes and tell me whether these would actually=
 implement
the changes you would want to see? I think the BIO layer is a generic inter=
face of
the block layer in the kernel, isn't it?

We could do that for sure. But I would like to hear your opinion on the cha=
nges
contributed by Oracle engineers first. Maybe their improvements are much be=
tter
so that it might make sense to try to upstream them.
