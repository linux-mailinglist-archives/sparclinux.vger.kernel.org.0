Subject: [PATCH] sparc32: register memory occupied by kernel as memblock.memory
Date:   Sun, 24 May 2020 19:53:58 +0300

From: Mike Rapoport <rppt@linux.ibm.com>

sparc32 never registered the memory occupied by the kernel image with
memblock_add() and it only reserved this memory with meblock_reserve().

With openbios as system firmware, the memory occupied by the kernel is
reserved in openbios and removed from mem.available. The prom setup code in
the kernel uses mem.available to set up the memory banks and essentially
there is a hole for the memory occupied by the kernel image.

Later in bootmem_init() this memory is memblock_reserve()d.

Up until recently, memmap initialization would call __init_single_page()
for the pages in that hole, the free_low_memory_core_early() would mark
them as reserved and everything would be Ok.

After the change in memmap initialization introduced by the commit "mm:
memmap_init: iterate over memblock regions rather that check each PFN", the
hole is skipped and the page structs for it are not initialized. And when
they are passed from memblock to page allocator as reserved, the latter
gets confused.

Simply registering the memory occupied by the kernel with memblock_add()
resolves this issue.

Tested on qemu-system-sparc with Debian Etch [1] userspace.

David,

I'd really appreciate your Ack or an explanation where my analysis is wrong :)
