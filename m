Maybe I mis-read the code, but I don't see how this could happen. In the
HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP=y case, free_area_init_node() calls
calculate_node_totalpages() that ensures that node->node_zones are entirely
within the node because this is checked in zone_spanned_pages_in_node().
So, for zones from different nodes to overlap in the pfn range the nodes
themself should overlap. Is this even possible?
