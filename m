Let us not do this. Reading config space is really expensive on some
architectures. Requiring a driver to do it twice on some values does not
improve upon that situation. And is quite redundant if the Root Complex
driver already knows that the first access has failed.

Additionally since multiple config accesses to the same devices is not
allowed in the spec, the hardware must block and wait for a timeout if
a config access does not get a response.
(Can happen if a intermediate link between the RC and endpoint has to retrain)
Having to block twice is very much not ideal. And in the case with
retraining the secondary access might even succeed. As the link might
recover between reading the first config word and reading PCI_VENDOR_ID.
Thus allowing the driver to accept invalid data from the device.

What about strange PCI devices such as Non-Transparent bridges?
They will require their own PCI Config space accessors that is not
connected to a host bridge if one wants to do some sort of
punch-through enumeration.
I guess the kernel doesn't care much about them?
