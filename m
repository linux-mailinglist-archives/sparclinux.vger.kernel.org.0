Hello,

since there has been a lot of recent activity around the Linux kernel on SP=
ARC
and there are also a lot of issues to be dealt with and unmerged patches, I=
 have
decided to summarize the current state of the Linux kernel on SPARC to brin=
g
anyone interested up to date.

First, let's start with the bugs. For a while it has been known that recent=
 kernel
versions can be very unstable on certain SPARC machines, this has been obse=
rved in
particular with UltraSPARC III CPUs but also on certain newer CPUs such as =
SPARC T1.

After I started bisecting the issue, I ran into multiple false positives un=
til I
identified d53d2f78cead as the culprit which makes use of a new vmalloc fla=
g called
VM_FLUSH_RESET_PERMS.

However, this particular change is actually not broken but rather just unco=
vered the
original bug. The introduction of VM_FLUSH_RESET_PERMS allowed the kernel t=
o flush
TLBs earlier after booting and more often. And since the original problem w=
as suspected
with the TLB flush management on SPARC, it was just natural that the change=
 in d53d2f78cead
turned out in the bisect.

Further investigation showed that the actual culprit are the CPU-specific i=
mplementations
of copy_{from,to}_user which can be found in arch/sparc/lib. These are brok=
en on different
CPU types to a different degree which explains perfectly fine why recent ke=
rnels are more
unstable on certain CPU types than on others.

Luckily, Michael Karcher has already made good progress in investigating an=
d fixing these
bugs so that, for example, a trial patch for the UltraSPARC III showed that=
 a simple
one-line change would fix all the stability issues currently seen on these =
CPU types.

It is expected that a series of patches will follow shortly that will addre=
ss the bugs in
the copy_{from,to}_user on all affected CPU types. In the mean time, it sho=
uld be possible
to switch the kernel to the generic code for copy_{from,to}_user that can b=
e found in the
same source directory to get a stable system on any CPU type.

Another issue that was discovered was that support for HugeTLB was broken o=
n sun4u. A patch
addressing the problem has been posted by Anthony Yznaga in [1]. Additional=
 pending patches
fix the error handling in the scan_one_device() [2] and switch sparc64 to t=
he generic vDSO
library [3].

Once the stability issues have been fixed, the focus should be on upstreami=
ng feature patches
that Oracle engineers developed but never sent in for review. These can be =
found in Oracle's
Github repository for the UEK kernel in the uek4/qu7 branch [4].

These feature patches include useful additions such as support for kexec [5=
], 5-level page
table support [6], EFI support for newer servers [7], support for SPARC M8 =
[8], fixed for
SPARC M7 [9] and even support for running the Linux kernel as a primary LDO=
M [10] and many
other improvements.

So, there is definitely a lot of work to be done on Linux for SPARC so that=
 we're going to
be busy for some more years. Hopefully, some folk from Oracle can step in a=
nd help upstreaming
some of the patches of Oracle's UEK kernel. Primary domain support in parti=
cular would be
very nice to have on Linux as this would allow creating logical domains on =
sun4v hardware
without having to install Solaris.

Cheers,
Adrian
