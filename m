IMHO, it is worth renaming to make the code easier to follow.
Especially after adding the buddy hardlockup detector that is
not using NMI context.

And I agree that that we should rename all callers as well.
Otherwise, it might be seen just as an extra churn.

d) sounds reasonable given that there is about 70 callers.

My understanding is that kernel guarantees ABI compatibility only for
the userspace (do-not-break-userspace rule). But the kernel ABI
is not guaranteed [*]

It actually has even a positive side effect because it motivates
module developers to upstream the code.

Of course, there should be a good reason for the change. And I think
that we have a good reason.

[*] This is valid for upstream. Another story is with linux
    distributions. They usually maintain the kernel KABI
    stability to some degree when backporting upstream changes.

Petr
