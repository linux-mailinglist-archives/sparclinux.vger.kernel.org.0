Hi,
I feel honored to be suggested for such a responsibility. I could in the
long term be available for a role as some kind of SPARC (co-)maintainer,
with backing from my organization. My SPARC experience is mainly with
SPARC32 rather than SPARC64, so discussing a co-maintainership with a
SPARC32 focus would feel natural as a start. I do not have much in terms
of SPARC64 or non-LEON SPARC32 hardware available for testing.

Has someone reached out to Dave? I think discussions like these might
be better served in a thread of its own.

Cheers,
Andreas Larsson
