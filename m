Looked at my "museum". At least 5 pcs of sparc32 boxes but I guess
the NVRAM needs repair on all of them.

I have a LEON4 board somewhere on the shelf too.
None of this powered up for years either - but I cannot make myself
getting rid of it. Because maybe one day I find time...

All that said - I have also once suggested to drop sun4m support,
keeping only the LEON parts. Back then there was some resistance,
but all for sentimental reasons and I can relate to that, since
I kept the sparc32 boxes around.

Yeah, I'm blind. Somehow the grep output tricked me.
