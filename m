Actually, on heavy-stress NetBSD choked! it never did in the past years. 
so time to look at it.

Could be... one never knows. Today I spent time with the Netra T1 to get 
it back on track. I got two new RAM sticks. The Battery hack I did 
Friday seems to hold quite well, content remains stored, RTC worked over 
the weekend.

What I rembered is that I did not "set-defaults" before working on it... 
content seemed good to boot,  for safety, I redid it.
I discovered that Not all RAM DIMMS combinations were good and that a 
NVRAM reset even improved things, very strange, but that it is.
Things like two new DIMMS did not work as "upper" two slots, but left 
alone in the first two slots were fine. But old DIMMs put in upper 
resulted in a stable system with NetBSD. I stress tested it and for sure 
enough I used enough RAM as well as I let diag run at boot. Good thing, 
also, the reliable system I need as NFS server and lots of things is back.
I ordered some new NVRAM chips though, we shall see how new ney will be 
and if it is worth changing my hacked one. Also I want to improve my 
hack with a battery holder in the future.

Sure, there are no specific compiler optimizations, but I wonder if they 
are really the same and what could change in the machines.
In theory, just cache sizes, CPU speed.. and possibly other minor things 
(e.g. if one board accepts 1GB modules, the other only 512MB ones, sure 
some details differ).

Strong of an apparently goot Netra T1 with NetBSD 10.1, I tried the 
linux disk again.

I stressed the old kernel a bit:
  6.1.0-9-sparc64 #1 Debian 6.1.27-1 (2023-05-08) sparc64 GNU/Linux

And this time also on the Netra T1 it proves good: I recovered 
filesystem journal, I can run apt-get upgrade, install things. 
Regenerated ramdisk, etc Definitely "hold" this kernel version for 
future safety.
Minor new kernel to test plus your 6.17 kernel, which choked on fsck / 
journal replay (but now fixed with 6.1 kernel).

Newly installed mainline kernel:

Another reboot into 6.1  - all fine!

Now, a bit more confident about my hardware, I would say stock 6.16 and 
your 6.17 do have issues on the T1 200 with IIe
