I did some root cause analysis. I *know* that the issue happens when %sp points into
uncommitted memory on the stack when the system call is invoked. If you add a printf
after the variable-length array has been reserved on the stack, you cause the target
stack page to be faulted in, so %sp is no longer hovering over uncommitted memory.
That's what the +/-22 comes from: I target to get %sp in call_clone (that is %fp in
clone) aligned to a page boundary. clone then reserves 24 64-bit-words on the stack
(without touching them). If the page boundary that %fp hovers over is
the lowest-address committed stack page, %sp will get into (yet) uncommitted memory.
wasting 24 words less make %sp get to the bottom of the last committed page, so the
issue does not appear. wasting at least 24 extra words cause the 7th argument to
clone to appear on the yet uncommitted page, and generates a page fault that commits
this page before clone is invoked.

Now that's the point where the guesswork starts: the kernel entry for clone, vfork and
fork issues "flushw" to flush the register windows to the stack. In the problematic
situation, this will hit address space without a committed page behind it. If I understand
the save trap handler in the kernel correctly, it detects that it is called from
kernel-space, and that the saving happens to user-space memory. In that case, the kernel
*disables* MMU fault traps, tries the saving, and the checks whether some writes got
dropped due to a fault by checking a MMU status flag. In that case, the kernels saves
the register into some backup location, because the kernel requires that saving the
user-space register to stack works, even if the user-mode stack is "bolixed".

Now, clone clones (pun intended) the frame of the caller into the stack of the new
"thread" (let's not argue whether the thing clone creates is a "lightweight procss",
a "thread", an "execution flow of some indetermined kind" or whatever), which is the
area between %sp of the caller frame and %fp of the caller frame. I guess the call
goes haywire at the point when %sp points to the backup location, but %fp points to
the user-mode stack (or possibly some different backup location), and "the area
between %sp and %fp" is no longer a well-defined memory range.

Let me know if you want file names / line numbers into the kernel source to back up
the facts and guesswork I wrote.

Kind regards,
   Michael Karcher
