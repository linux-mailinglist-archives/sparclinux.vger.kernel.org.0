OK, fair enough. My current plan is to wait a few more days to see if
anyone else chimes in with opinions. If I don't hear anything, in my
next version I will rename _neither_ touch_nmi_watchdog() nor
arch_touch_nmi_watchdog(). I'll still add comments indicating that
these functions touch the "hardlockup" watchdog but I won't attempt
the rename just to keep the series simpler.
