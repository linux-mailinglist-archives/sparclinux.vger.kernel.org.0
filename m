This seems appropriate as well to me.

"qemu-system-sparc -M help" shows a "leon3_generic" platform, apparently
added in 2013. Do you think that would be sufficient?

My best guess from the public information I could find on LEON is that
it keeps shifting away from Linux on LEON to other OSs, and to
and to Linux on NOEL-V.

So even though the CPU itself will likely have a long life ahead of it
with LEON5 only a year old, it's unclear how many more updates
we'll see to the kernel from the current 4.9 based release.

Thanks. I'd probably queue up a patch in my asm-generic tree for
v5.12 to disable SMP on all SPARC32, add the helpers for C-Sky
once Guo Ren has tested a patch, and clean up the futex code based
on this. I guess we want the one-line fix for Arm that Thomas suggested
for v5.10 and backports anyway, The sun4m/sun4d removal should
clearly be discussed separately and go through the sparc tree, to see
if anyone has objections, or if we want to remove other obsolete
platforms (sun3?) along with it.
