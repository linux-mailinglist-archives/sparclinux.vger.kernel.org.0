I'm still very interested in this topic. Do you have anything concrete
that is broken? Your reply gives me the vibe that there have been a
bunch of bugs found recently and, while there are no known issues,
you're worried that there might be something lingering still. Is that
correct, or do you have something concrete that's broken? Is this
anything others could help with? I could make an attempt, or we might
be able to rope some of the others interested in this topic and more
GIC-knowledgeable to help?

I still have a goal for turning this on for production but obviously
don't want to make the device crashier because of it.

Also: if this really has known bugs, should we put a big WARN_ON splat
if anyone tries to turn on pseudo NMIs? Without that, it feels like
it's a bit of a footgun.

To followup with this, we've formulated a plan for dealing with
Mediatek Chromebooks. I doubt anyone is truly interested, but if
anyone is the details are in the public Google bug tracker [1]. None
of that should block lading the NMI backtrace series.

The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea of going full
hog on the idea in patch #10. I've posted v9 [2] where I've really
embraced the idea of falling back to a regular IPI if NMI isn't
available. Hopefully it looks keen.
