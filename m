I'm not arguing this. This was more about killing (sub-)architectures because they
haven't seen git activity for a long time which I think is poor metric to determine
whether a port is dead or not. And reading through the other answers in this thread,
it seems I'm not alone with this stance.

Good to hear.

It's an obvious conflict.

I'm happy to hear that. For me personally, it also has a very educational value
as the non-mainstream platforms such as m68k offer more places of code to hack
on for adding features such as SECCOMP which are still missing there.

There are usually enough people working on architectures such as x86 and ARM,
so there is not much room for hobbyist activities. Also, you risk making much
more people upset if you break something.

I am already doing that as much as I can for various architectures such as ia64,
m68k, SH and POWER, SPARC although I need to ramp up my activity a bit more. I have
also now added myself for the linux-alpha mailing list to test and ack patches for
the Alpha architecture as well.

I have to admit I have quite a number of pet architectures but that's because I'm
co-maintaining these architectures in Debian Ports with regular releases of Debian
installation images for these targets:

Thanks for the pointer. I'm not so much active in kernel development itself yet, but
I'm also trying to be more active. Although the kernel is not the only project that
sometimes needs attention for these pet architectures. We're also confronted with
deprecation problem in problems such as GCC although we recently saved the m68k
(and VAX) backends in GCC with the help of a Bountysource campaign. The AVR backend
is also backed by such a campaign and currently being worked on.

We are even getting an m68k backend for LLVM hopefully soonish, so we will even be able
to build the Linux kernel for m68k with clang :-).

There is such a patch set for arch/sh to add device tree support, but so far it has not
been merged yet, unfortunately. Apparently, it causes some regression on LANDISK devices
according to Rich Felker.

Maybe we can finally get it merged this year:

Since Geert also has a LANDISK SH device now for testing, he might be able to help.

Oh, and if anyone else is interested in helping with the SH port, I'm happy to send
them a free LANDISK or NextVoD SuperH device - the latter has a 450 MHz ST-40
CPU and 256 MB RAM.

Is there a list of architectures which still need highmem?

Thanks for the kind words. I appreciate the input.
