Just FYI.

Guenter tripped over a problem with an I/O BAR set to zero.  I think
your arches allow that (at least they "#define PCIBIOS_MIN_IO 0"), and
some drivers don't handle such BARs.  More details below.

Note that I didn't actually cc you on the thread, mostly because I
forgot but partly to avoid exploding the cc list with people who
probably don't care.  If you want to respond directly to the thread,
you can use this:

I guess this is the "#define PCIBIOS_MIN_IO 0x1000" in
arm64/include/asm/pci.h.  From a PCI point of view, I'm not opposed to
changing that to 0, as it is on csky, riscv, sh, sparc, um.  But it's
really an arch question, so the arm64 folks would have to weigh in.

But I don't think that would fix this.  PCIBIOS_MIN_IO is mainly used
when we assign or reassign resources to a BAR, and if firmware tells
us to preserve the assignments done by firmware, Linux shouldn't be
doing any assignment or reassignment.

Linux received 00:01.0 BAR 0 as [io 0x0000-0x007f], and Guenter didn't
report any reassignment, so I assume Linux saw the
DSM_PCI_PRESERVE_BOOT_CONFIG [1] and didn't change anything.

Could this be due to drivers assuming that an I/O BAR of 0 is invalid?
I see that at least ne2k_pci_init_one() [2] seems to assume that.  And
tulip_init_one() [3] and pci_esp_probe_one() (am53c974.c, [4]) use
pci_iomap() [5], which fails if the resource starts at 0.

So pci_iomap() is probably already broken on the arches above that
allow I/O BARs to be zero.  Maybe pci_iomap() should only fail on
"!start" for *memory* BARs, e.g.,
