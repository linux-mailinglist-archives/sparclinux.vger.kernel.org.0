Moving lower down the stack to use a bio directly is not a good idea,
it's in fact going the opposite direction of what we'd like to see in
the storage stack. And it would then mean you'd need to implement your
own internal requeueing and retrying.

These are the kind of changes that happen when development is done and
changes aren't submitted upstream. It's unfortunate drift...

Won't help this case, and it's actively going the wrong direction
imho...
