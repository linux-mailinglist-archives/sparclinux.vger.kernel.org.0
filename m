Hi Catalin,

Thanks for taking a look at this patch. I felt mmap() silently accepting 
PROT_ADI but not really enabling protection can be dangerous since it 
leads the end user to be under false impression that they have protected 
the memory. I chose to treat PROT_ADI as a known flag and provide a 
definite feedback to user whether it can be honored or not.

Yes, 'addr' is an unused argument now. On the other hand, I suspect with 
additional protections being implemented in hardware for memory regions, 
sooner or later someone will see a need to validate protection bits in 
the context of memory region it is being applied to. Address is not 
going to be enough information though and we are most likely going to 
need size of the memory region being operated upon as well. That means 
this code is likely to need a patch to add the size argument. So it is 
reasonable to remove 'addr' for now and reintroduce a more complete 
version with size as well later in a patch when the need comes up.
