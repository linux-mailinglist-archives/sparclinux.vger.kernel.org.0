Looking at the csum_and_copy_... instances on various architectures,
noticing that and going "how the fuck could it possibly work and
what moron had broken it?  Oh, lovely - it couldn't, it doesn't
and that moron had been myself ;-/"

qemu image only, TBH - I have an SS20 box, but it hadn't booted for
about 10 years...

Er?  No EX2 in checksum_32.S...  There is one in copy_user.S,
but that one _is_ used -

copy_user_table_end:
        be      copy_user_last7
         andcc  %g1, 4, %g0

        EX(ldd  [%o1], %g2, and %g1, 0xf)
        add     %o0, 8, %o0
        add     %o1, 8, %o1
        EX(st   %g2, [%o0 - 0x08], and %g1, 0xf)
        EX2(st  %g3, [%o0 - 0x04], and %g1, 0xf, %g1, sub %g1, 4)
