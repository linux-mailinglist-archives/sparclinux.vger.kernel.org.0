>>>      fs: remove compat_sys_mount

Some participants in the discussion over at the debian-sparc list mentioned
"NFS" and "Invalid argument", which is something I know just too well from
iptables. NFS is a filesystem that uses an extra data blob (5th argument to the
mount syscall). Such blobs have historically not always been designed to bear
the same layout between ILP32 and LP64 modes, and nfs's structs fell prey to
this as well.

My hypothesis now is that fs/nfs/fs_context.c line 1160:

	if (in_compat_syscall())
		nfs4_compat_mount_data_conv(data);

and ones similar to it (I didn't look too close where nfs3 gets to do its
conversion), no longer trigger as a result of compat_sys_mount being
wiped from the syscall table:

I didn't extract from the debian-sparc discussion whether people were running
the all-LP64 userspace, or had some older Debian with a ILP32-on-64bitkernel
setup.


[But that's just a theory - a kernel theory!]
