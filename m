It's not necessarily about well behaved but whether it can have security
implications. On arm64, if the underlying memory does not support MTE
(say some DAX mmap) but we still allow PROT_MTE driven by user, it will
lead to an SError which brings the whole machine down.

Not sure whether ADI has similar requirements but at least for arm64 we
addressed the mmap() case as well (see my other email on the details; I
think the approach would work on SPARC as well).
