I'd forgotten about that. Fair point =3D)

Yeah, my issue is that I have no CRTs anymore - all my monitors are
LCDs and none of them sync to the frequencies SUNs use.

So yeah, you can make adapters (i have home-made adapters to convert
both ways) however out of the 4 monitors I own with VGA ports, none of
them sync to Sun frequencies.

That's almost exactly what I was planning to do, but I'd still be
lacking a Linux distro to run.

Same.

IIRC there's some ancient versions that have the bits to netboot a
SparcStation so you can then do the necessary stuff to install the
minimal binaries and stuff, at which point you can do the various
configurations, pull in the latest portage tree and emerge world,
however the last time I tried this, the disk I was using - my last one
- failed somewhere in the middle of that process.

My distcc plan was to have it talk to a cross compiler on my x86
desktop. I never got to the point where it would have actually used
it.

QEMU is somewhat slow and never _exactly_ the same as real hardware,
so I can see why distros might not use it as a build machine or
whatever. And if they do build for QEMU and it doesn't work on real
hardware, then we have a distro that's only for virtual hardware and
that seems pointless.

You're right that with the right bits and pieces resurrecting a
Sparc32 machine is relatively "easy", however there's still no modern
distros supporting this ancient hardware so the upstream kernel has
most likely bitrotted.

I still don't think it's worth saving.

Thanks,
