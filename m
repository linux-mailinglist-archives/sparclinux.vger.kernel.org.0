My thinking was more that most of the time the error checking may
be completely bogus to start with, and I would just not check for
errors at all.

That would require changing all callers of the function, which
I think would involve changing some 700 files. What I was
suggesting was to only change the return type to void and
categorize all drivers that today check it as either

a) checking the return code is not helpful, or possibly even
    wrong, so we just stop doing it. I expect those to be the
    vast majority of callers, but that could be wrong.

b) Code that legitimately check the error code and need to
   take an appropriate action. These could be changed to
   calling a different interface such as 'pci_bus_read_config_word'
   or a new 'pci_device_last_error()' function.

The reasons I suspect that most callers don't actually need
to check for errors are:

- Most error checking is static: PCIBIOS_BAD_REGISTER_NUMBER
  only happens if you pass an invalid register number, but most
  callers pass a compile-time constant register number that is
  known to be correct, or the driver would never work. Similarly,
  PCIBIOS_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND wouldn't normally happen
  since you pass a valid pci_device pointer that was already
  probed.

- config space accesses are very rare compared to memory
  space access and on the hardware side the error handling
  would be similar, but readl/writel don't return errors, they just
  access wrong registers or return 0xffffffff.
  arch/powerpc/kernel/eeh.c has a ton extra code written to
  deal with it, but no other architectures do.

- If we add code to detect errors in pci_read_config_*
  and do some of the stuff from powerpc's
  eeh_dev_check_failure(), we are more likely to catch
  intermittent failures when drivers don't check, or bugs
  with invalid arguments in device drivers than relying on
  drivers to get their error handling right when those code
  paths don't ever get covered in normal testing.

Looking at a couple of random drivers that do check the
return codes, I find:

drivers/edac/amd8131_edac.c: prints the register number,
then keeps going. This is not useful

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx4/reset.c: error handling
in mlx4_reset() seems reasonable, but it gets called
from mlx4_pci_resume(), which has a 'void' return code and
cannot propagate the error further. My guess is that it
would try to keep going after a failed resume and run into
random other problems then.

drivers/ata/pata_cs5536.c: error code gets passed to
caller and then always ignored. Can clearly be changed

drivers/net/wireless/intersil/prism54/islpci_hotplug.c:
Out of two calls, only one is checked, which seems bogus

drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c: only one of many instances
has a check, again this seems bogus.

drivers/leds/leds-ss4200.c: called from probe(), which
seems to correctly deal with errors by failing the probe.
Not sure this can ever fail though, since the driver only does
it after pci_enable_device() succeeds first. Note that
pci_enable_device() ignores pci_read_config_byte()
errors but sanity-checks the register contents/
