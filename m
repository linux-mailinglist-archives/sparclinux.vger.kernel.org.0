Hopefully Greg will reply to that one.

Because it does not end with I/O operations, that's a trivial example.
module unloading is famous for being racy: I just re-read that part of
virtio drivers and sure enough we have bugs there, this is after
they have presumably been audited, so a TDX guest is better off
just disabling hot-unplug completely, and hotplug isn't far behind.
Malicious filesystems can exploit many linux systems unless
you take pains to limit what is mounted and how.
Networking devices tend to get into the default namespaces and can
do more or less whatever CAP_NET_ADMIN can.
Etc.
I am not saying this makes the effort worthless, I am saying userspace
better know very well what it's doing, and kernel better be
configured in a very specific way.

Well I commented on the API patch, not the virtio patch.
If it's a way for a driver to say "I am hardened
and audited" then I guess it should at least say so. It has nothing
to do with host or sharing, that's an implementation detail,
and it obscures the actual limitations of the approach,
in that eventually in an ideal world all drivers would be secure
and use this API.

Yes, if that's the API that PCI gains then virtio will use it.

I guess they aren't really needed though right, or you won't try to
filter them? So make them configurable?

To clarify, the policy is which drivers to load into the kernel.
