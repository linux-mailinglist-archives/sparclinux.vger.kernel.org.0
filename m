Fair. These barriers were present in the original buddy lockup
detector that we've been carrying in ChromeOS but that doesn't
necessarily mean that they were there for a good reason.

Reasoning about weakly ordered memory always makes my brain hurt and I
never feel confident at the end that I got the right answer and, of
course, this is coupled by the fact that if I have a logic error in my
reasoning that it might cause a rare / subtle bug. :( When possible I
try to write code that uses full blown locks to make it easier to
reason about (even if less efficient), but that's not necessarily
possible here. While we obviously don't just want to sprinkle barriers
all over the code, IMO it's not a terrible sin to put a barrier in a
case where it makes it easier to reason about the order of things.

In any case, I guess in this case I would worry about some sort of
ordering race when enabling / disabling the buddy lockup detector. At
the end of the buddy's watchdog_hardlockup_enable() /
watchdog_hardlockup_disable() we adjust the "watchdog_cpus" which
changes buddy assignments. Without a barrier, I _think_ it would be
possible for a new CPU to notice the change in buddies without
noticing the touch. Does that match your understanding? Now when
reasoning about CPUs going online/offline we need to consider this
extra case and we have to decide if there's any chance it could lead
to a false lockup detection. With the memory barriers here, it's a
little easier to think about.

Did the above convince you about keeping the barriers? If so, do you
have any suggested comment that would make it clearer?

Sure, I'll add that to my list of things to follow-up with.

The main reason I did it is that "hrtimer_interrupts" is static to
watchdog.c now. If I don't pass it in then I have to make it
non-static and add it to the header. That also means anyone looking at
the variable and figuring out how it is read/written needs to go
search for other people that reference it. I feel like it's cleaner to
just pass it in. If you feel strongly that I should change this then
let me know, but otherwise I'll plan to leave this how I have it.

Yup, I'll get rid of the copy.

The goal is to have "HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PREFER_BUDDY" to show up as
an option if there is an option _other_ than the buddy. If there's not
more than one hardlockup detector to pick from then there's no reason
to ask the person configuring the kernel which one they'd prefer. At
the moment, if you have an "arch" lockup detector then you're stuck
with it, so you only get a choice if a "perf" detector is available
and you've got SMP.

Ah, so I guess this could be simplified to:

depends on HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF && SMP

OK, I'll add that to the list.

This isn't a new dependency, but it's a good question. Looking at the
git history, I see commit dea20a3fbdd0 ("[PATCH] Disable
DETECT_SOFTLOCKUP for s390"). ...and it looks like the softlockup
detector still says it's broken on s390. That would mean that the
buddy detector is broken too.

I agree that it's confusing. I'm obviously biased, but IMO it's less
confusing after my patchset than before. ;-) The state of the world
before my patchset set a pretty low bar.

As far as I understand it, at an architecture-level you can choose any
_ONE_ of the following:

a) Implement bits needed for the the "perf" hardlockup detector. x86
has done this, some configs of powerpc do this, and arm64 now after my
patch series. This is HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF.

b) Implement your own totally separate hardlockup detector that
doesn't use any of the common "perf" code but still looks the same to
userspace (same sysctls, etc). Only powerpc does this (in some
configs). As per conversations in previous versions of my patch
series, apparently powerpc's version is quite fancy and maybe someday
people can move some of these features to the common code. This is
HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_ARCH.

c) Don't implement the full features of a hardlockup detector but
still have the basics. In the very least, I think it doesn't support
the sysctls "hardlockup_panic" and "hardlockup_all_cpu_backtrace". It
doesn't support the kernel command line parameter "nmi_watchdog=3D". I
don't know for sure if there are any other differences. Only sparc64
does this. This is HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG. Confusingly,
HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_ARCH selects HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG.

d) Don't implement _any_ hardlockup detector of any sort. After my
patchset you can still end up with "buddy" if you have SMP.


One thing that would probably help would be to bring sparc64 to a full
"arch" hardlockup implementation and then get rid of the special case.
That seems a bit outside my scope, though if someone wanted to post
patches for that I'd be willing to give them a review.

I guess other than that, the best we could try to do is to rename some
configs and/or add some subconfigs to describe certain features? Maybe
HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG =3D> HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_ARCH_BASIC_FEATURES
would help? I'd love to come up with a better name for
HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_NON_ARCH but I couldn't come up with one.
Maybe the unwieldy  "HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_THAT_COUNTS_HRTIMER"?

If you have concrete suggestions for what would be cleaner, let me
know and I can queue up a patch. ...or I'm happy to review a patch.
