I don't think that's the case. If anything people might be a bit more
inclined to accommodate GPL exports for out of tree modules that use
them.

We wouldn't break any symbol for no reason, but in this case there is a
good reason. If the name change is important for clarity then we change
it. And this is about the easiest change for an out of tree module to
deal with, so it should be no big deal for them.

Thanks,
