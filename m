I have three: two SparcStation 10s and a SparcStation LX.

If I want to run them, assuming the hardware still works, I need to
netboot them as I cannot find working, compatible HDDs for them as
everything has switched to SATA or SAS.

Then there's the issue of finding a monitor as they're not
electrically compatible with VGA and I'm pretty sure none of the VGA
compatible monitors I have or can lay hands on works with their
specific sync frequencies.

Ultimately it's one of those things where there's enough "stuff" in
the way that booting one up for fun is simply impractical and they're
old and slow enough that they're not useful for anything else.

Then we get to the not-so-significant issue of software...

Interesting project!

Amusingly enough you're not the first to hook an FPGA up to sBus. I
had a card that was some form of high-speed sampling thing which was
effectively some electrically isolated front-end hooked to a Xylinx
FPGA. I ended up trashing it as it had no markings and I couldn't find
out anything about it.

And here's where the problem lies. The last (official) version of
Debian to support Sparc32 was Etch and I believe it was one of the
last ones to drop support.

I believe that Gentoo is architecture-neutral enough that it'd work,
but I believe that you'll have to compile everything - there'll be no
pre-built anything for sparc32 - and as it's fairly slow hardware by
today's standards, that's going to take a long time, however you could
probably use distcc and cross-compilers to speed it up.

Long painful story short, it's difficult to get the hardware running,
there's practically no Linux distros that support it, and the kernel
code has probably bitrotted due to lack of testing.

As much as it pains me to say this, I think this code's time has come
and it's time to get rid of it.

If there were more people using it or more testing, or more distros
supporting it - not just (theoretically?) working on it - then I'd be
fighting to keep it.

But there isn't.

I think it's time for it to go.

Thanks,
