Another fun aspect of old hardware is it serves as prior art for patents. The
j-core hardware implementation schedule has in part been driven by specific
patents expiring, as in "we can't do $FEATURE until $DATE".

It's much easier to nip a patent suit in the bud if you can go "here is
functionally equivalent hardware from the past, dates the specifications were
published, and the specific patents on the technology which have now expired".

We're a little overscheduled and not always _prompt_ about it, but for example
the reason we couldn't do full 6-wire sd 1.0 in the first j-core SOC release
(and had to implement a painfully slow mmc bus instead) is the patents hadn't
expired yet.

For 3 years in the 1990's SuperH was the best-selling processor in the world,
and that's left the architecture with a bunch of legacy boards that aren't
easily available to us. I regression test a current kernel build under qemu
every month or two, and have portable USB-powered boards for the j-core stuff.

When I did an sh4 porting contract in 2018 I got that board updated to a
current-ish kernel (3 versions back from then-current it hit some intermittent
nor flash filesystem corruption that only occurred intermittently under
sustained load; had to ship so I backed off one version and never tracked it
down). But these days I'm not always on the same continent as my two actual sh4
hardware boards, have never gotten my physical sh2 board to boot, and $DAYJOB is
all j-core stuff not sh4.

Testing that a basic superh system still builds and boots under qemu and j-core
I can commit to doing regularly. Testing specific hardware devices on boards I
don't regularly use is a lot harder.

We did that one for our SOC. We haven't ported a lot of legacy boards because we
can't easily test most of them.

I don't believe it does? (We haven't got any configs using it, anyway...)

My todo list runneth over. One of our perpetual todo list items is "collate todo
lists"...
