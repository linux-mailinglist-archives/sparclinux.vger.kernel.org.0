This patch series adds the "buddy" hardlockup detector. In brief, the
buddy hardlockup detector can detect hardlockups without arch-level
support by having CPUs checkup on a "buddy" CPU periodically. All the
details are in the patch ("watchdog/hardlockup: detect hard lockups
using secondary (buddy) CPUs") and I encourage folks to reply to that
patch for general comments about this approach.

Note that in v3, this was a single patch [1]. It's now exploded into a
much larger series. The much larger series does a bunch of cleanup
that Petr requested in response to v3 [2] [3]. This new series ends up
sharing a lot more code with the perf lockup detector. It also tries
to bring a little sanity to some of the naming we had.

The fact that this series now touches across the whole lockup detector
codebase also caused conflicts with the series trying to add a arm64
perf-based hardlockup detector. That was a bit incovenient for me
since I was testing on arm64 and wanted to make sure that the perf
and buddy hardlockup detectors both compiled and worked. Because of
this, I've pulled the latest arm64 perf-based lockup detector patches
into my series. Specifically:
- Patches #1 - #3 of the arm64 perf-based lockup detector patches were
  generic cleanups. I added them early in my series. IMO these should
  just land.
- Patches #4 - #6 of the arm64 perf-based lockup detector patches were
  less generic but still caused conflict with my series. I tacked them
  to the end of my series after adapting them to my changes. However,
  I don't really consider them part of this series and I'd be OK if
  the series landed without them. For use cases I'm aware of the buddy
  system is sufficient and I see no urgent need to land the arm64 perf
  hardlockup support, though I also don't have any strong objections
  to the patches.

I will note that this patch series currently has no conflicts with the
other patch series I posed recently adding support for pseudo-NMI
based backtraces [5] and the two patches series are meant to work
together.

Given the new design of this patch series, testing all combinations is
fairly difficult. I've attempted to make sure that all combinations of
CONFIG_ options are good, but it wouldn't surprise me if I missed
something. I apologize in advance and I'll do my best to fix any
problems that are found.

I'll also note that the CC list is pretty giant. Some of this is based
on get_maintainers and some of this is people I thought might be
interested. Now that this series is touching so many files, I've
stopped auto-CCing everyone that get_maintainers suggests. I'll reply
to v3 and point at this patch to make sure folks are aware of it, but
if I stopped CCing you and you want back on then please yell.

As far as I can tell, there's no true MAINTAINER listed for the
existing watchdog code. Assuming people don't hate this, maybe it
would go through Andrew Morton's tree? There is now some arch-specific
code for sparc and powerpc, but it's all still watchdog code so
hopefully that would still be fine to go through the same tree.
