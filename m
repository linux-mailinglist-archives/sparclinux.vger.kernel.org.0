For arm64 mte, I noticed the arch_validate_prot() issue with multiple
vmas and addressed this in a different way:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux.git/commit/?h=for-next/mte&id=c462ac288f2c97e0c1d9ff6a65955317e799f958
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux.git/commit/?h=for-next/mte&id=0042090548740921951f31fc0c20dcdb96638cb0

Both patches queued for 5.10.

Basically, arch_calc_vm_prot_bits() returns a VM_MTE if PROT_MTE has
been requested. The newly introduced arch_validate_flags() will check
the VM_MTE flag against what the system supports and this covers both
mmap() and mprotect(). Note that arch_validate_prot() only handles the
latter and I don't think it's sufficient for SPARC ADI. For arm64 MTE we
definitely wanted mmap() flags to be validated.

In addition, there's a new arch_calc_vm_flag_bits() which allows us to
set a VM_MTE_ALLOWED on a vma if the conditions are right (MAP_ANONYMOUS
or shmem_mmap():
