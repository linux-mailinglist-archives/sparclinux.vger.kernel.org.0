No, these just appear in dmesg, most of them do not seem to cause a crash because I did not have so many boots.My dmesg capture is unfortunately flaky with MikroTik SSH jumphost or Sun ALOM dropping the SSH console connection often.

All tests after that start with this instruction and continue with random ones - I just overwite the start of opcode buffer with this.

Did not manage to capture this. Since this was the later kernel, I have it still around and retested - there was no "fixing up ..." message befor the crash (probably).

OK, will try them together - I did try one by one so far and applied some (at least one) by hand but I think successfully - might have failed because I applied it to the wrong state of code.

  
> I think the important test cases are c1a01040 (which should be fixed by the first code patch) and cf95d1ef, (which should be fixed by the second code patch.)


Will try the patches incrementally and with both constants for overwriting the start of the opcode block.
