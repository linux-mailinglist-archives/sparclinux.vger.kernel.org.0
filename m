It's also worth emphasizing that there are likely to be systems that
support AES instructions but are not using them due to the corresponding
kconfig options (e.g. CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES_NI_INTEL) not being set to 'y'.
As we know, missing the crypto optimization kconfig options is a common
mistake.  This series fixes that for single-block AES.

So (in addition to the aes-fixed-time case) that's another case that
just gets faster, and where the difference between aes-generic and the
new generic code isn't actually relevant.
