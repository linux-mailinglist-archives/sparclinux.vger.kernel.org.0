Hello,

I originally reported this to Debian
(https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1006157), which
advised me to re-report it upstream.  The context is an ext4
filesystem on a sparc64 host.  I've observed this with each of the
three sparc64 Debian kernels that I've tested.  Those kernels were
5.16.0-1-sparc64-smp, 5.15.0-2-sparc64-smp, and 4.9.0-13-sparc64-smp.

   * What exactly did you do (or not do) that was effective (or
     ineffective)?

See the included file for a minimal test program.  It creates two
processes, each of which loops indefinitely.  One opens a file, writes
0x1 to a 256-byte region, and closes the file.  The other process
opens the same file, reads the same region, and prints a message if
any byte is not 0x1.

This thread has more discussion and a more-configurable test program:
https://postgr.es/m/flat/20220116071210.GA735692@rfd.leadboat.com

   * What was the outcome of this action?

The program prints messages, at least ten per second.  The mismatch
always appears at an offset divisible by eight.  Some offsets are more
common than others.  Here's output from 300s of runtime, filtered
through "sort -nk3 | uniq -c":

   1729 mismatch at 8: got 0, want 1
   1878 mismatch at 16: got 0, want 1
   1030 mismatch at 24: got 0, want 1
     41 mismatch at 40: got 0, want 1
    373 mismatch at 48: got 0, want 1
     24 mismatch at 56: got 0, want 1
    349 mismatch at 64: got 0, want 1
  13525 mismatch at 72: got 0, want 1
    401 mismatch at 80: got 0, want 1
    365 mismatch at 88: got 0, want 1
      1 mismatch at 96: got 0, want 1
     32 mismatch at 104: got 0, want 1
     34 mismatch at 112: got 0, want 1
     19 mismatch at 120: got 0, want 1
     34 mismatch at 128: got 0, want 1
    253 mismatch at 136: got 0, want 1
    149 mismatch at 144: got 0, want 1
    138 mismatch at 152: got 0, want 1
      1 mismatch at 160: got 0, want 1
      4 mismatch at 168: got 0, want 1
      7 mismatch at 176: got 0, want 1
      4 mismatch at 184: got 0, want 1
      1 mismatch at 192: got 0, want 1
     83 mismatch at 200: got 0, want 1
     58 mismatch at 208: got 0, want 1
   3301 mismatch at 216: got 0, want 1
      2 mismatch at 232: got 0, want 1
      1 mismatch at 248: got 0, want 1

If I run the program atop an xfs filesystem (still with sparc64), it
prints nothing.  If I run it with x86_64 or powerpc64 (atop ext4), it
prints nothing.

   * What outcome did you expect instead?

I expected the program to print nothing, indicating that the reader
process observes only 0x1 bytes.  That is how x86_64+ext4 behaves.

POSIX is stricter, requiring read() and write() implementations such
that "each call shall either see all of the specified effects of the
other call, or none of them"
(https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html#tag_15_09_07).
ext4 does not conform, which may be pragmatic.  However, with x86_64
and powerpc64, readers see each byte as either its before-write value
or its after-write value.  They don't see a zero in an offset that
will have been nonzero both before and after the ongoing write().


=== sparc64-ext4-zeros.c
/*
 * Stress-test read(), and write() to detect a problem seen with sparc64+ext4.
 * Readers see zeros when they read concurrently with a write, even if the
 * file had no zero at that offset before or after the write.  This program
 * runs indefinitely and will print "mismatch ..." each time that happens.
