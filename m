The Linux kernel is configurable. If you want a small kernel, then just
configure one. No one expects you to boot a fully-fledged distribution
kernel on these machines.

That makes no sense. It worked in the past, why shouldn't it work nowadays?

As I said, you disable everything you don't need. I'm booting my SH-7785LCR
SuperH board with a kernel that is less than 4 MB in size and which includes
everything I need.

Or just configure a smaller kernel.

I haven't gotten around to setup my SPARCstation 5 yet, but I will certainly
going to do that later this year to give it a try.

We build anything SPARC on a SPARC T5 that we have for Debian, no need
for cross-compilation and that machine is actually quite fast.
