We have only use QEMU for LEON3 on limited and simpler system
setups. For example the Zephyr SPARC arch + LEON3 BSP port we recently
submitted to the Linux Foundation Zephyr project run their test-suite
successfully on QEMU+LEON3. We will have to look into the QEMU for LEON
and Linux situation.

We mainly use TSIM that is our own high fidelity simulator.

Regarding unconditional compare-and-swap-atomic instructions (CASA) for
LEON. I tried to get those into mainline under the LEON configuration
option but did not get OK for that at that time, with the feedback to do
it dynamically instead. I haven't come around to try to get an updated
patch doing probing instead into mainline yet. If the thought now is to
drop support for SMP for sparc32, maybe we can have the CASA
unconditionally on SMP configured kernels instead. Still we'd like to
have CASA usage even for non-SMP kernels for LEON systems that supports
it.

I would not say that we are stuck on an old kernel. It is rather that
for our official releases we stay on long term support kernels. We still
aim for kernels based on master to work on LEON. Right now we do have a
bit of backlog of things to get into upstream.

On the contrary. Our LEON users shows an increased interest in running
Linux, now that LEON-based systems gains in number of processors,
processor performance and memory. We are adding NOEL as a new processor
line. With NOEL we have a 64-bit architecture. We are not shifting from
LEON to NOEL. LEON is not going away.

Our latest release was indeed based on 4.9, but we have no plans to stay
there forever. We just tend to select long term support kernels for our
official releases. The next step will be to go to 5.4 if not 5.10.

We recently released a new Linux 4.9 toolchain where we stepped up to
GLIBC 2.31 and GCC 10.2. So we do not consider us stuck at old versions
of any of the involved software.

In addition, non-LTS users are running other mainline kernel versions
as well.
