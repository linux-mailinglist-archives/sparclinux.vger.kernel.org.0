	Is virtio-blk-pci more resilent to lost interrupt bug introduced in 
"sun4u: update PCI topology to include simba PCI bridges"?  I hadn't tried
it yet (reverted to the last working mainline qemu commit for now); IDE
definitely is screwed by that - both the Linux and NetBSD drivers, actually.

	A 50Mb worth of wget(1) is more than enough to trigger that crap;

commit 063833a6ec
Merge: d634fc0499 bcf9e2c2f2
Author: Peter Maydell <peter.maydell@linaro.org>

    Merge remote-tracking branch 'remotes/mcayland/tags/qemu-sparc-signed' into staging

hangs, d634fc0499 works, bcf9e2c2f2 hangs.

I hadn't looked into details (the branch itself is only two commits long, but it
incorporates an openbios update - 35 commits there, some obviously pci- and
sun4u-related), but it's really easy to reproduce - -m 1024 and -hda <image>
are probably the only relevant arguments.  Even dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/null bs=64m
is often enough to hang it, so I rather doubt that networking (e1000 on pciB,
FWIW, with tap for backend) has anything to do with that.
