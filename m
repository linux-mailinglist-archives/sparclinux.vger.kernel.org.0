I don't know either.  I think we currently try to assign the max
possible VF resources based on TotalVFs.  If that allocation fails,
none of the VFs are usable, even if we could have allocated smaller
areas and at least used *some* of the VFs.

That seems like it might be a little too aggressive because it makes
a device that supports a huge number of VFs completely unusable on a
platform with limited MMIO space, when we could in principle make it
usable with fewer VFs.
